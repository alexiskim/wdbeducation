            <p class="description">
                Ya'll have given me this power to go off about anything I wanted so I'm about to talk about this new game.
                <br>
                
                <div class="intro-outro">
                    <span id="game-name">Hades</span> is a roguelite dungeon crawler by Supergiant Games. 
                    It follows Zagreus, son of Hades, who is attempting to escape the Underworld. He is aided by various Olympians who
                    strengthen and protect him during his getaway.

                    <h3 id="story-title">Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        As in many rogue-like games, Hades uses the gameplay mechanism of you probably dying many many many times as
                        something to help push along the story.
                        <br> Everytime Zagreus inevidently emerges back in the House of Hades from
                        River Styx, characters have new things to talk to you about. New places open up and new cutscenes are available.
                        Also, you'll unlock more dialogue when encountering different Olympians as well. 
                        I can't say much about the story, because I'm just getting into it too, but it's cool
                    </p>

                <div class="gameplay">
                    <h3 id="gameplay-title">Gameplay</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's a rogue-like game. You will <span id="emphasis-on-die"> die like a lot </span>, but dying and failing is also a big part of the game.
                        Every escape attempt, you'll collect rewards that can help strengthen Zagreus back in the House of Hades.
                        It makes every run feel worthwhile.
                        During escape attempts, you'll face changing chambers, enemies, and bosses. Every run feels unique due to 
                        some random elements, and you'll definitely feel a sense of progress throughout.

                        First, omg the artsyle is so gorgeous! The character portraits are so unique and detailed.
                        Even though it literally takes place in the Underworld, the environments are lively and colorful.
                        Supergiant is sort of known for making games isometric. It gives the game so much character.

                    I have too much to talk about but not about to write out all my thoughts rn, and I half hope someone read this and thought about 
                    <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/" class="link">looking into Hades and supporting an independent game company.</a>
